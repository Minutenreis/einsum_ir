\section{Conclusion}

This work showcased four new algorithms to speed up \texttt{einsum\_ir} with distributed memory parallelization in MPI.
The algorithms showcased promising performance, outperforming the existing shared memory parallelism of \texttt{einsum\_ir} on two dual socket systems.
I also outlined which next steps need to be taken in order to include these algorithms into \texttt{einsum\_ir}.
