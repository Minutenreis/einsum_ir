\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Algorithm Implementations}

The algorithms, testing scripts and use of the algorithms is demonstrated in 
\href{https://github.com/Minutenreis/einsum_ir}{my fork of einsum\_ir on github}.
A description for how the data got generated is in \\
\texttt{Bachelor\_Arbeit/data/results.readme}.
The master-worker algorithm is implemented in \texttt{bench\_binary\_mpi.cpp} while the other three algorithms are implemented in \texttt{bench\_tree\_mpi\_dist.cpp}.
The m and n algorithm described in this work is equivalent to the \texttt{contract\_distributed\_m\_n\_out\_n} algorithm in \texttt{bench\_tree\_mpi\_dist.cpp}.
The c and the k algorithm are described in\\ \texttt{contract\_distributed\_c} and \texttt{contract\_distributed\_k} respectively.

\subsection{Hardware used}

The AWS g8c.metal-48xl was used with the ami-03b37c21960cc5a6e image and 100 GiB of storage.
