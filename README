To install and execute the programs on a fresh Graviton g8c instance, follow the steps below:
* execute `install_g8c.sh` to install the necessary packages, check out the repository, and compile the programs
* execute `g8c_bench_tree.sh` to rerun the benchmarks demonstrated in the thesis.

For Grace instead follow the steps below:
* execute `install_grace.sh` to install the necessary packages, check out the repository, and compile the programs
* execute `grace_bench_tree.sh` to rerun the benchmarks demonstrated in the thesis for the comparison between shared memory and distributed memory.
* execute `grace_bench_master_worker.sh` to rerun the benchmarks for the master worker implementation.
* execute `grace_bench_mw_comp.sh` to rerun the benchmarks for comparing the distributed implementation to the master worker implementation
** important note: you must copy the code from `/src/backups/bench_tree_mpi_dist_mw_comp.cpp` to `/src/bench_tree_mpi_dist.cpp` before running the script. (otherwise the contractions differ)

The visualization scripts reside in `/Bachelor_Arbeit/data` together with all data collected and a `results.readme` that outlines how the data was collected.
Only `visualize_10_g8c.py`, `visualize_10_grace.py`, and `visualize_mw.py` are used in the thesis.
